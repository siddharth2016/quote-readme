“Software is a gas; it expands to fill its container.”— Nathan Myhrvold  
“All parts should go together without forcing.  You must remember that the parts you are reassembling were disassembled by you.  Therefore, if you can’t get them together again, there must be a reason.  By all means, do not use a hammer.”— IBM Manual, 1925  
“Standards are always out of date.  That’s what makes them standards.”— Alan Bennett

“In a room full of top software designers, if two agree on the same thing, that’s a majority.”— Bill Curtis

“Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren’t doing anything.  One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them.  Very often they’re sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space.  What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.”— Charles M. Strauss   
“If you think you are worth what you know, you are very wrong.  Your knowledge today does not have much value beyond a couple of years.  Your value is what you can learn and how easily you can adapt to the changes this profession brings so often.”— Jose M. Aguilar

“If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.”— Alan Perlis  
“How rare it is that maintaining someone else’s code is akin to entering a beautifully designed building, which you admire as you walk around and plan how to add a wing or do some redecorating.

“Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization.  I think we should be just as worried about premature design — designing too early what a program should do.”— Paul Graham   
“Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight: You don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going, and you don’t know quite where you are.”— Danny Thorpe   
“The best way to predict the future is to implement it.”— David Heinemeier Hansson   
“We need above all to know about changes; no one wants or needs to be reminded 16 hours a day that his shoes are on.”— David Hubel   
“On two occasions I have been asked, ‘If you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?’  I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.”— Charles Babbage   
“Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.”— Albert Einstein   
“Today, most software exists, not to solve a problem, but to interface with other software.”— IO Angell   
“Good specifications will always improve programmer productivity far better than any programming tool or technique.”— Milt Bryce

“Perl: The only language that looks the same before and after RSA encryption.”— Keith Bostic   
“I didn’t work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me.  No language can be perfect for everyone.  I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it’s not perfect for you.  The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.”— Yukihiro Matsumoto, aka “Matz”, creator of Ruby

“Companies spend millions of dollars on firewalls, encryption and secure access devices, and it’s money wasted, because none of these measures address the weakest link in the security chain.”— Kevin Mitnick   
“If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don’t understand the problems and you don’t understand the technology.”— Bruce Schneier  
“Hoaxes use weaknesses in human behavior to ensure they are replicated and distributed.  In other words, hoaxes prey on the Human Operating System.”— Stewart Kirkpatrick
